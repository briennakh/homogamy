This is a list of simuPOP objects and methods that are particularly important
for troubleshooting. 

SimuPOP's variable interface is murky and really does not follow typical python
conventions.


pop.genotype(0)                 lists all genotypes. (why 0? look up.)
                                Doesn't work for vsps.


ACCESSING AND ITERATING THROUGH INDIVIDUALS
pop.individual(n).sex()         either displays 1 or 2 to represent M/F
pop.individual(n).genotype()    displays the genotype. Not sure in what format.
pop.individuals                 an iterable to iterate through each
                                individual in a population. Useful for
                                either getting or setting attributes for
                                each individual.
                                e.g. for individual in pop.individuals


ACCESSING ALLELE FREQUENCIES AND GENOTYPES DURING SIMULATIONS

SimuPOP keeps variables in a dict called Population.vars() or as attributes
of an object Population.dvars()

Population.evolve() has an "operator" called Stat which calculates things and
stores them in the local namespace under an unspecified name (argh!!!).
But this name could be figured out by inspecting Population.vars().

pop.dvars(sp).alleleFreq[locus][allele]     the allele frequency at
                                            locus [locus] and allele [allele]
                                            for subpopulation sp. Note that
                                            these are dicts, not lists.
                                            

                             
                                    

            




LOOKING AT THE BIG PICTURE; TROUBLESHOOTING

sim.dump(pop)                   Outputs all data about all individuals
                                in a semi-tabular format.

describeEvolProcess(param)      Accepts the same parameters as Simulator.evolve.
                                Outputs a description of how an evolutionary
                                process will be executed.

moduleInfo                      Outputs a dict with information about the
                                version and build of simuPOP. See:
